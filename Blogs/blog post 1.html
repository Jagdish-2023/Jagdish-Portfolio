            <h2 class="heading">DEFINING THE INTERNET:</h2>
            <p>
                The internet is a vast network of interconnected computers and devices spanning the globe. It originated
                from ARPANET, a U.S. Department of Defense project, and has evolved into the worldwide network we know
                today.
            </p>
            <h2 class="heading">INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE:</h2>
            <p>
                The internet relies on servers, routers, and data centers to function. Servers host websites and handle
                requests from clients, while routers direct data packets across the network. Data centers store and
                process vast amounts of information. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) connect users to the internet.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="all-box" id="box2">
            <h2 class="heading">Protocols and Standards:</h2>
            <p>
                Protocols and standards define the rules and procedures that govern communication on the internet.
                TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a foundational protocol suite that ensures
                reliable data transmission and facilitates communication between devices connected to the internet. TCP
                manages the division of data into packets, ensures their reliable delivery, and reassembles them at the
                destination. IP, on the other hand, is responsible for addressing and routing packets across the
                internet. It assigns unique IP addresses to devices and uses routing tables to direct packets to their
                intended destinations. Other protocols, such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), govern specific
                applications. HTTP is the protocol used for web browsing, allowing web browsers to request and receive
                web pages from servers.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="all-box" id="box3">
            <h2 class="heading">Domain Names and DNS:</h2>
            <p>
                Domain names provide human-readable addresses for websites, making it easier for users to navigate the
                internet. Instead of memorizing complex IP addresses, users can simply type in a domain name (e.g.,
                www.google.com) to access a website. Behind the scenes, the Domain Name System (DNS) acts as a directory
                service that translates domain names into corresponding IP addresses. When a user enters a domain name
                in a browser, the browser sends a DNS query to a DNS server. The DNS server looks up the requested
                domain name in its database and returns the corresponding IP address. This IP address is then used to
                establish a connection with the web server hosting the requested website, allowing the user to access
                the desired content.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="all-box" id="box4">
            <h2 class="heading">Data Transmission</h2>
            <p>
                Data transmission involves the movement of information across the internet. To facilitate efficient and
                reliable transmission, data is divided into smaller units called packets. Each packet contains a portion
                of the original data and includes necessary routing information. These packets are transmitted over the
                internet, following different paths based on network conditions and routing decisions made by routers.
                Upon reaching their destination, the packets are reassembled in the correct order to recreate the
                original data. This packet-switching method ensures that data can be transmitted in a flexible and
                efficient manner, allowing for reliable communication across the internet's diverse network
                infrastructure.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="all-box" id="box5">
            <h2 class="heading">Security and Encryption:</h2>
            <p>
                Security is a crucial aspect of internet communication. Encryption plays a significant role in securing
                data transmitted over the internet. It involves encoding data using cryptographic algorithms, making it
                unreadable to unauthorized individuals. When data is encrypted, it can only be decrypted using the
                corresponding decryption key. This ensures the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information,
                such as passwords, credit card details, and personal data, as it travels across the internet. SSL/TLS
                (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) protocols provide a framework for establishing secure
                connections between clients and servers. They use encryption algorithms to encrypt data during
                transmission, preventing eavesdropping and unauthorized access to sensitive information.

        <div class="all-box" id="box6">
            <h2 class="heading">The World Wide Web (WWW):</h2>
            <p>
                The World Wide Web, often referred to as the "Web," is an information space within the internet that
                consists of interconnected web pages. Web browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, allow users to
                access websites by entering URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) into the address bar. URLs consist of
                various components, including the protocol (e.g., HTTP or HTTPS), the domain name (e.g.,
                www.example.com), and the specific resource or page being requested. When a user enters a URL, the web
                browser initiates an HTTP request to the corresponding web server. The server responds by sending back
                the requested web page, which the browser then renders and displays to the user. HTML (Hypertext Markup
                Language) is the primary language used to structure and present web content. It defines the elements and
                formatting of a web page, allowing for the inclusion of text, images, links, multimedia, and interactive
                elements. Hyperlinks are a fundamental feature of the Web, connecting different web pages together. By
                clicking on hyperlinks, users can navigate from one web page to another, allowing for a seamless
                browsing experience.

            <h2 class="heading">Emerging Technologies:</h2>
            <p>
                The internet continually evolves with emerging technologies that shape its future. The Internet of
                Things (IoT) refers to the connection of everyday objects, such as appliances, vehicles, and wearable
                devices, to the internet. It enables these objects to collect and exchange data, leading to enhanced
                automation, efficiency, and interconnectivity in various aspects of our lives. 5G connectivity is the
                next generation of wireless technology, offering faster data speeds, lower latency, and greater capacity
                compared to previous generations. With 5G, users can expect improved performance for applications such
                as video streaming, online gaming, and real-time communication. Cloud computing provides on-demand
                access to computing resources and storage over the internet. It allows businesses and individuals to
                scale their operations efficiently, as they can access and utilize computing power and storage capacity
                without the need for extensive on-premises infrastructure. Artificial intelligence (AI) is being
                integrated into various internet services, enhancing user experiences through personalized
                recommendations, chatbots, intelligent data analysis, and automation of tasks. AI-powered algorithms can
                understand user preferences, interpret vast amounts of data, and deliver tailored content and services,
                revolutionizing industries such as e-commerce, digital marketing, and customer support.
